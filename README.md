# JS-The-Hard-Parts-V2
This repository is a summary of my experience taking the frontend masters course: JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2 by Will Sentance. The content is organized into reviews and exercises.

Reviews are the mental models I came up with whilst going through each section of the course. It's a summary of what was taught, answers I found online to questions I had whilst reviewing the content, and overview of any experiments I conducted in a bid to understand more.

Exercises are my solutions to the pair programming challenges prepared for each section of the course.
